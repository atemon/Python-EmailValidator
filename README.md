Python-EmailValidator
=====================

We can get a brief idea of if email address is valid or not using regular expressions. Currently with thousands of new TLDs its bit too hard. This tool uses nslookup command to check if a mail exchange server is configured for a domain. This could be the best level of email validation other than actually sending (unsolicited) mail.
